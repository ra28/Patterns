# Patterns

* The <b>Strategy</b> pattern defines family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. (<i> Parts that are prone to change are separated, you can easily add new duck or new behavior without changing a whole concept, every duck can have separated behavior, without composition and with inheritance, all ducks should implement all methods - lot of code</i>).
